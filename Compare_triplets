PROBLEM :
#Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from to for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
#We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .
#Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing with , with , and with .
#If , then Alice is awarded point.
#If , then Bob is awarded point.
#If , then neither person receives a point.
#Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
#Given and , determine their respective comparison points.
#For example, and . For elements , Bob is awarded a point because . For the equal elements and , no points are earned. Finally, for elements , 
#so Alice receives a point. 
#Your return array would be with Alice's score first and Bob's second.
