#Problem : 
#Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
#Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.
#For example, . Our minimum sum is  and our maximum sum is . We would print
#26 24
#Function Description
#Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below. It should print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of  of  elements.
#miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):
#arr: an array of  integers

ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(ar[:-1]), sum(ar[1:]))
